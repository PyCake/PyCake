# PyCake
PyCake is an old-school assistant that works together with your OS to provide you with an awesome user experience!
# What is PyCake?
PyCake is a program that acts like an assistant to you!
# What can PyCake do?
PyCake can Create, Rename, Delete, Read the contents of, and Move files. He can also List the items in a directory (folder), get info about your computer (nothing personal or private just info about its capabilities).
# Is that it?
No! He logs every action you perform with him. This history can be viewed as a .log file. He can also record logs you make! You can then see all the logs you've made as well! 
# How do I Install him?
Simply download the .zip file, extract it, and run the only script in it! PyCake automatically detects if you have installed him before and if you haven't he will install himself! Unfortunetly because of my lack of knowledge about Windows systems, PyCake is only confirmed and tested to work on Mac OSX 10 and above. (if you have a Windows device and test this let me know if it works!)
# Is it ready for use? 
Currently PyCake is in version Magnum PY 1.0.0 and is being worked on continually! While he can be used as is we recommend waiting until an automatic updating script is added. Otherwise you will have to re-download daily.
# What is it coded (scripted really) in?
PyCake is currently scripted in Python (hence Py Cake). If you can/will translate it into another language that makes it easier to use please let me know! Anyone who can translate it into a more easy-to-use language will be added to the team and thanked in the credits!
# Can I help?
Yes! Of course! Simply let me know and tell me what you can do and I will let you know if I wil accept the changes!
# Requirements:
You MUST have the latest version of Python, and you must also have IDLE. 
# How to use:
Simply right click on the download file named: PyCake.py and then select open with IDLE. You may have to click the Other... button and then find the IDLE app.
